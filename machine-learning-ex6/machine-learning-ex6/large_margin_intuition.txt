Large Margin Intuition
======================
- Remember these conditions when thinking of the following principles:
- When C is large, the cost function J = C * 0 + sum(theta^2)

Observation 1:
=> We are trying to make theta as small as possible!

Then we ask, how do we get large margin?
- Theta is perpendicular to the decision boundary!
- z = theta * x, which is a dot product between theta and x (projection). 
  This is how we get theta * x == p * theta, where p is the length of projection
- We are also optimizing so that theta * x > 1 when y = 1, and theta * x < -1 when y = 1

Observation 2:
=> If we are optimizing to make min(theta), observation 1, then to have theta * x > 1 
   or theta * x < -1 is equivalent to maximizing p (since theta * x == p * theta)
