Selecting Optimal Regularization and Model
==========================================

let lambda_set = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... }
let theta_set = { 3, 4, 5, 6, ... }

Select lambda and model:
lambda = 0
theta = 3

Train on given theta and lambda using training set...

For each lambda/theta combination:
Compute:
========
J_train(theta) where lambda = 0
J_cv(theta) where lambda = 0

Choose the best (theta, lambda) pair that has lowest J_cv



Questions:
==========
- How do you know when to increase features as opposed to reducing regularization?
- How do you know when optimizer is reaching local minima as opposed to having a problem of bias or variance?
