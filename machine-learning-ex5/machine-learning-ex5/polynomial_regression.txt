Polynomial Regression
=====================
We can re-represent polynomial regression as linear regression of a hyper plane to a data set
To learn theta_0 * x + theta_1 * x^2 + theta_2 * x^3 + ...
We can re-write x^2 and x^3 as a different features:

x_0 = x
x_1 = x^2
x_2 = x^3
...

Thus h = theta_0 * x_0 + theta_1 * x_1 + ...
